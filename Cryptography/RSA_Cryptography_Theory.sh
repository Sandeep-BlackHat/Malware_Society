#RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. It is also one of the oldest. 
#The acronym RSA comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977. <RSA (cryptosystem)>

#An example of asymmetric cryptography :
#A client (for example browser) sends its public key to the server and requests for some data.
#The server encrypts the data using client’s public key and sends the encrypted data.
#Client receives this data and decrypts it.

>> Generating Public Key :
'Select two prime no. Suppose P = 53 and Q = 59.
Now First part of the Public key  : n = P*Q = 3127.

 We also need a small exponent say e : 
But e Must be 

An integer.

Not be a factor of n.
 
1 < e < Φ(n) [Φ(n) is discussed below], 
Let us now consider it to be equal to 3.

    
Our Public Key is made of n and e'

>> Generating Private Key :

'We need to calculate Φ(n) :
Such that Φ(n) = (P-1)(Q-1)     
      so,  Φ(n) = 3016

    
Now calculate Private Key, d : 
d = (k*Φ(n) + 1) / e for some integer k
For k = 2, value of d is 2011.

'Now we are ready with our – Public Key ( n = 3127 and e = 3) and Private Key(d = 2011)

Now we will encrypt “HI” :

Convert letters to numbers : H  = 8 and I = 9

    
Thus Encrypted Data c = 89e mod n. 
Thus our Encrypted Data comes out to be 1394


Now we will decrypt 1394 : 
Decrypted Data = cd mod n. 
Thus our Encrypted Data comes out to be 89

8 = H and I = 9 i.e. "HI".'
