Malware is the collective name for a number of malicious software variants, including viruses, ransomware and spyware. Shorthand for malicious
software, malware typically consists of code developed by cyberattackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network. Malware is typically delivered in the form of a link or file over email and requires the user to click on the link or open the file to execute the malware.
